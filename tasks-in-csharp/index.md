## Introduction

In this tutorial, we're going to look at task-based approach provided by C# .NET for async and parallel programming.

If you are new to async and parallel programming in C# I will highly recommend that you go through my tutorials [Multithreading In C#](/multithreading-in-csharp/) and [Thread Synchronization In C#](/thread-synchronization-in-csharp/) before proceeding further.

## Modules

*   [Introduction To Parallel Programming Using C# Tasks](./introduction-to-parallel-programming-using-csharp-tasks/)
*   [Getting Started With C# Task](./getting-started-with-csharp-task/)
*	[Programming For Responsiveness](./programming-for-responsiveness)

## What You Will Learn

*   What is task?
*   Task exectuion model.
*   Harvesting result from task.
*   Task handling techniques.
*   Exception handling in task.

## Requirements

*   You will need Visual Studio IDE (for programming in C# .NET) to get started with this tutorial.
*   All demos in this tutorial are built using Visual Studio and complete solution demo is available [here.](https://github.com/kudchikarsk/tasks-in-csharp)

## Issues

*   You can also use the Comments section at the bottom of each module to ask a question or report a problem.
