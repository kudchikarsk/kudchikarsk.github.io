C# Operators are symbols that tells the .NET CLR to perform specific operations on operands for producing the final result. C# has a number of standard operators, taken from C, C++ and Java. Most of these should be quite familiar to programmers. 

The table below lists the standard operators. Note that when writing classes it is possible to change the default behaviour of some of these operators (ie to 'overload' the operator), although this should only be done where the resultant semantics makes sense. The below table also indicates which of the operators are overloadable.

 Logical or | `c||d` | No
 Conditional | `int c=(d<10) ? 5:15` | No

## C\# Operator Overloading

To overload an operator in a class, one defines a method using the 'operator' keyword. For instance, the following code overloads the equality operator. <!--(see lesson 13 for details about methods).-->

```cs
public static bool operator == (Value a, Value b)
{
	return a.Int == b.Int
}
```

Where an operator is one of a logical pair, both operators should be overwritten if any one is. These pairs are the following:

```
== and !=
< and >
<= and >=
```
