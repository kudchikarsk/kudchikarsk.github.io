## Introduction

In this tutorial we will discuss the issue in terms of program correctness in a multithreaded program. And then we'll take a look at some of the thread synchronization techniques that are available to you as a CLR or .NET programmer.

If you are new to multithreading in C# I will highly recommend that you go through my tutorial [Multithreading In C#](/multithreading-in-csharp/) before proceeding further.


## Modules

* [Thread Synchronization And Race Condition](./thread-synchronization-and-race-condition)
* [Thread Synchronization Techniques](./thread-synchronization-techniques)

* How to use Monitor class in C#.

## Requirements

*   You will need Visual Studio IDE (for programming in C# .NET) to get started with this tutorial.
*   All demos in this tutorial are built using Visual Studio and complete solution demo is available [here.](https://github.com/kudchikarsk/thread-synchronization-in-csharp)

## Issues
